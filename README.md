This is a credit point assignment for the course "Programming games with Raspberry Pi and Python" that I took at the Informatica Feminale 2018 in Bremen, Germany. The course took place over three days from August 13-15,2018.

In order to get the credit point, we have to take the existing code of clocks.py by Lars Heppert and make the following changes:

- change the appearance of the clock, i.e. colors, size and width of elements, overlay an image in the center etc.
- make the clock run backwards
- ensure that the clock is centered in the window even when the shape of the clock is rectangular, not square
